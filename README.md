## Introduction

Radii is a modular, expressive assistant framework built for civic tech, accessibility, and real-time responsiveness. Designed to feel alive, Radii blends AI-style interactions with hardware-grade reliability—whether you're building accident detection systems, alert platforms, or just want your assistant to vibe with users.
Radii is a standalone, modular assistant framework built for expressive, real-time interaction across civic, accessibility, and alert-driven applications. It supports multi-language execution environments including Python, C++, and Go, and offers components for encrypted communication, adaptive feedback, and multilingual broadcast logic. Designed for clarity, flexibility, and presence, Radii enables developers to build assistants that go beyond utility—delivering responsiveness, personality, and system-grade reliability without relying on external ecosystems or hardware dependencies.
